# Quant Visualizer

Quant Visualizer is a web application that demonstrates one of the classic quantitative finance ideas â€” **pairs trading**.  
The app lets you pick two stocks, analyze how closely they move together, and backtest a simple long/short strategy.

## How It Works

1. Select a pair of stocks and time range.  
2. The app fetches price data and computes correlation and z-scores.  
3. Charts show how the two assets behave relative to each other.  
4. Backtest simulates a simple strategy:  
   - Long the better-performing stock  
   - Short the weaker stock  
   - Profit comes from their relative performance, not market direction.
